"""The strategies a fresh install finds in its workspace.

The workspace used to seed ONE file, an EMA 9/21
crossover, which is the toy every charting package ships and says nothing
about what this terminal is for. These seven are quant strategies: each one
states the effect it is trying to harvest, measures the regime it needs, and
sizes or gates itself accordingly.

They are held as source STRINGS rather than .py files in the package because
the engine ships frozen (PyInstaller): code in the PYZ always travels, loose
data files only travel if the spec lists them.

House rules every one of these follows, because a starter people copy is a
house style whether you meant it or not:

  * Decide on bar i, fill at bar i+1's open. Nothing reads a price it could
    not have known. The one exception is an intrabar stop, which fills at
    the stop level (or the open, if the bar gapped through it) because the
    level was fixed before the bar began.
  * Every rolling statistic is causal: .rolling()/.ewm() only, never a
    centred window, never a full-sample fit.
  * Parameters live in `params` with defaults, so the same file can be swept
    from the UI without editing code.
  * Horizons are stated in DAYS and converted to bars from the dataset's own
    spacing. A lookback written in bars means eight days on hourly gold and
    eight months on daily Apple, which is how one file quietly becomes two
    different strategies; every starter measures the bar first.

VOL_TARGET_TREND = '''# Volatility-Targeted Trend

#
# The fix: size every entry so its notional targets a CONSTANT annualised
# volatility. In calm markets you carry more, in turbulent markets less, and
# the risk taken per trade stops depending on when the trade happened. Most
# of the Sharpe difference between a naive trend rule and a managed-futures

VARIANCE_RATIO_SWITCH = '''# Variance-Ratio Gated Trend
#
# The effect being tested: whether trend following pays is not a fixed
# property of an instrument, it is a property of the CURRENT regime, and that
# regime is measurable before you trade it. The Lo-MacKinlay variance ratio
# compares the variance of q-bar returns with q times the variance of 1-bar
# returns:
#
#     VR(q) = Var(r_t + ... + r_(t-q+1)) / (q * Var(r_t))
#
# Under a random walk VR = 1. VR > 1 means returns extend each other, which
# is the statistical signature of a trending regime; VR < 1 means they
# reverse. So: run an ordinary trend rule, but ONLY while the variance ratio
# says the market is in the regime that rule needs, and sit in cash the rest
# of the time.
#
# This file is deliberately the twin of vol_targeted_trend.py: same trend
# signal, same vol sizing, one extra gate. Run both on the same dataset and
# the difference IS the value of the regime test. That comparison is worth
# more than either number on its own, and it is the honest way to find out
# whether a filter earns its complexity.
#
# On the bundled data, measured with 2bp a side, the gate LOSES: hourly gold
# -11k against +178k ungated, hourly EUR/USD -40k against +15k, hourly S&P
# -22k against +154k, daily Apple +124k against +343k. That is the result,
# not a bug to tune away. A variance ratio measured over one window is a
# noisy estimate of a regime that may not persist long enough to trade, and
# every bar it holds you out of a live trend costs you the trend. Keep the
# file as the control experiment it is: change vr_hi, vr_days or q_days and
# watch whether the gate can be made to pay anywhere. If it cannot, that is
# worth knowing before you build something bigger on top of it.
#
# An earlier version of this file also traded a mean-reversion leg whenever
# VR < 1, so it was in the market in every regime. It lost on every bundled
# dataset: two strategies stapled together trade twice as often for no extra

# The effect: every moving average trades lag against smoothness, and picks
# that trade-off once, for all regimes. A Kalman filter picks it CONTINUOUSLY:
# model log price as a level moving at a latent velocity, and the filter
# weights each new observation by how surprising it is relative to the noise
# it has been seeing. The result tracks a real trend faster than an EMA of
# equal smoothness, and ignores single-bar shocks better.
#
# The tradeable output is the velocity itself, not the level. A real trend
# keeps the filtered slope pinned above its own noise band; chop leaves it
# oscillating around zero. Hysteresis (enter high, exit low) stops the
# position flickering on the boundary.

ENSEMBLE_KILL_SWITCH = '''# Signal Ensemble with an Equity Kill Switch
#
# Two ideas, both about survival rather than entry quality.
#
# 1. ENSEMBLE. Three uncorrelated-ish signals vote: a trend filter, a
#    breakout, and a stretch fade. Any single rule spends long stretches
#    wrong; requiring agreement cuts trade count hard but removes the trades
#    taken for one rule's idiosyncratic reason. This is diversification
#    across MODELS, which is the only free lunch left once you have
#    diversified across assets.
#
# 2. KILL SWITCH. The strategy tracks its own equity curve and stands down
#    while that curve is below its moving average, resuming when it recovers.
#    A rule that has stopped working usually keeps not working for a while,
#    and the equity curve is the earliest honest evidence you have. It cannot
#    look ahead: the switch reads only trades that have already closed.
