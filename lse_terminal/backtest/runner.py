"""Runs a plain-Python strategy script and measures what it did.

There is no framework here and nothing for the user to import. Their file is
ordinary Python; we execute it with the candles already in scope and read the
result back out of the namespace:

    # df is already defined. No imports of ours, no base class, no self.
    fast = df.close.ewm(span=9).mean()
    slow = df.close.ewm(span=21).mean()

    trades = []
    entry = None
    for i in range(1, len(df)):
        if entry is None and fast[i] > slow[i]:
            entry = i
        elif entry is not None and fast[i] < slow[i]:
            trades.append({"entry_i": entry, "exit_i": i, "dir": "long"})
            entry = None

Injected names:

* ``df``      the selected candles, a plain pandas DataFrame
  (ts, open, high, low, close, volume, plus any extra columns the dataset has)
* ``params``  a dict of overrides, empty on a normal run. Read defaults out of
  it (``fast = params.get("fast", 9)``) and walk-forward can then sweep the
  value without the script changing. This is the only reason it exists.
* ``data``    {name: DataFrame} of side datasets. The app attaches every
  imported series dataset (the bundled USYIELDS curve included), so a script
  can read data["USYIELDS"] with no setup; a file only loads if its name is
  actually read.

Read back:

* ``trades``  a list of dicts, the one required output.
* ``plots``   optional: a dict of name -> series, charted with the report so a
  run can SHOW what its filter saw. A value is a pandas Series / numpy array /
  list with one number per bar, or explicit [ts, value] pairs for a series on
  its own clock (a closed-trade equity track). Everything else in the
  namespace is ignored.

A trade dict needs an entry, an exit, and where in time each happened:

    {"entry_i": 10, "exit_i": 25, "dir": "long"}          bar indexes
    {"entry_ts": 1700000000, "exit_ts": 1700086400}       epoch seconds
    {"entry": 101.5, "exit": 104.0, "entry_i": 10, "exit_i": 25}

Keys are read liberally because this is the one place the user has to match us:
``dir``/``direction``/``side``; ``entry``/``entry_price``; ``exit``/
``exit_price``; ``qty``/``size``. Direction defaults to long. Prices default to
the open of the named bar, which is the honest fill for a decision made on the
bar before. Size defaults to the full account, compounding trade to trade;
give ``qty`` for an absolute quantity instead.

We do the part after the run: sizing, commission, the per-bar equity curve,
drawdown, sharpe and the rest. That is deliberately ours, because it is the
part nobody wants to write twice and the part that is easy to get quietly wrong.
